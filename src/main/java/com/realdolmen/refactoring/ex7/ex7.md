#Exercise 7: extract superclass

Truck and car have a lot of attributes/behaviour in common. We can avoid code duplication by extracting a common superclass. 


1. Extract the common attributes and methods into a superclass(right click on the class -> refactor -> extract superclass) and make sure both classes extend from it.
