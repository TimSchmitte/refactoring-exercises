#Exercise 6: Separation of concerns

Let's try to refactor this code to a business and data access layer using the techniques thought in this lesson.
Also note that a hibernate entity is passed straight to the RestController. 
This is a bad practice since it violates the separation of concerns, moreover this becomes confusing since both the id and promotions are not supposed to be set at hiring time but
respectively during persistence and when calling the promote endpoint. Create a jackson dto using the best practices thought earlier in the lesson and map this to the employee object.

The solution should contain at least 3 layers; the controller, a service containing the business logic and a repository/dao containing the data access logic.
